This is a program to predict daily rainfall in Bangladesh based on weather variables.
1. Preprocessing
   a. The dataset used is daily weather data for 10 years in Bangladesh
   b. Data is processed to determine zscore, minimum value, maximum value, missing value etc.
   
3. Visulalization
   a. Correlation plot between variables using Pearson correlation coefficient
   b. Predictive Power Score (PPS) plot used to evaluate the strength and type of relationship between variables in prediction
   c. Box plot
   
5. Model building
   The algorithms used are Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and KNearest Neigbors.

7. Evaluation
   a. The model is evaluated using recall, F1 score, and precision parameters
   b. ROC curve compared for each model
